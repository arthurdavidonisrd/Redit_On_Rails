# ReditOnRails (not finished yet)

## Project Purpose

The purpose of **ReditOnRails** is to serve as a hands-on learning project for mastering the core features and development patterns of the Ruby on Rails framework. Inspired by Reddit, this application focuses on building a social platform tailored to the tech community, where users can post content, comment, and engage in discussions around technology topics.

This project was designed with the intention of deepening practical knowledge of key Rails concepts, including:

- **Scaffolding** to quickly generate resources and speed up development.
- **Migrations** for evolving the database schema in a controlled and versioned manner.
- **Model Associations** to manage complex relationships between users, posts, comments, and other entities.
- **MVC Architecture** to separate concerns and follow Rails conventions effectively.
- **Partials and Layouts** for clean and reusable view templates.
- **Gem integration** to extend the application’s capabilities using the vast Ruby ecosystem.
- **Authentication with Devise** for managing user sessions, registration, and secure access.
- **Validations and Callbacks** to ensure data integrity and model behavior.
- **Flash messages and form helpers** for better user interaction and feedback.
- **Custom routes and controllers** to better control app behavior.

By working on this project, developers can gain practical experience with full-stack Rails development — from setting up databases and managing routes to creating reusable UI components and securing user accounts.

It’s a perfect sandbox to experiment, break things, fix them, and learn how to build scalable, maintainable Rails applications using industry best practices.
